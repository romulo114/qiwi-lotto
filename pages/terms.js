          Company will participate in the purchasing of Tickets and will hold a
          stake in the Tickets (including, but not limited to, in any Winnings
          attributed to those Tickets); this may be applicable where the Company

          not prohibited by the laws of any applicable jurisdiction from using
          the Services. The offering or availability of the Services and/or the

          by Us to use the Services and/or the Website if You reside in a place
          in which such use is currently forbidden by law or where the Company,
          at its sole discretion, elects not to offer the Services. We make no
          representations or warranties, expressed or implied, as to the

          Winnings from, any lottery draw in which You participate via the
          Services, and You hereby acknowledge that it is not Our responsibility

          clarified that a person who is not entitled to use the Services - as

          7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If You wish to purchase a Ticket, You must place
          a request via the Website to purchase a Ticket. The request does not
          amount to a purchase of a Ticket and/or to a right to purchase a
          Ticket. Your right to a Ticket is created only after the request is
          acted upon by the Company.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may require receipt of any
          documentation and/or information prior to purchasing any Ticket;
          failure to provide such documentation and/or information may result in
          the Company not purchasing any Ticket.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Your request to purchase a Ticket is
          recorded with the Company, the Company will (subject to the provisions
          of these Terms) purchase the Ticket in accordance with Your request;
          where You request to purchase a Ticket as part of a Program, the
          provisions of section 8 will apply in addition to the other provisions
          of these Terms.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, the Company will allow You to
          request to choose certain characteristics of the Ticket (e.g., the
          numbers to be chosen for the purposes of that Ticket's participation
          in the lottery draw), subject to the availability of such
          characteristics in the lottery draw in connection with which the
          Ticket is purchased and subject to the availability of such an option
          provided by the Company.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hereby clarified that the Consideration is
          higher than the price of the Ticket, and You hereby acknowledge that
          the difference between the Consideration and the price of the Ticket
          represents a fair compensation for the Company in connection with the
          Services it provides to You. You hereby waive any claim or argument in
          connection with the difference between the Consideration and the price
          of the Ticket, including, but not limited to, the fairness and
          appropriateness of such difference.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once You have requested to purchase a Ticket,
          You will not be able to cancel such a request, even if the Ticket has
          yet to be purchased by the Company. Therefore, all requests to
          purchase Tickets are final, non-fundable and non-terminable.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Ticket is purchased, it will be held
          and stored by the Company. A scanned copy of the Ticket will be
          delivered to you via email or available in Your Account. It is hereby
          clarified that the recording of Your request to purchase the Ticket
          does not amount to a purchase of a Ticket (and the Ticket is confirmed
          to be purchased only after a scanned copy of the Ticket will be
          delivered to you via email or available in Your Account), and We will
          not be held liable in connection with any such request where the
          Ticket was not purchased (or was purchased using other characteristics
          than the ones You asked for – including where the characteristics
          chosen by You appeared on the Website), including (but not limited to)
          where such occurrence was due to Our fault, gross negligence and/or
          negligence, human and/or technical errors and/or failures. It is Your
          sole responsibility to confirm that a Ticket was purchased according
          to Your request (including, but not limited to, the relevant
          characteristics).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without derogating from the provisions of
          section 7.7, it is hereby clarified that all requests to purchase a
          Ticket must be made at least 24 hours prior to the time of the lottery
          game or draw in respect of which the request to purchase a Ticket was
          made (the "24 Hours Period"); where the lottery game or draw is played
          and/or performed during or adjacent to a national holiday, bank
          holiday or any other day which is not a business day in the
          jurisdiction in which the Ticket applicable to that lottery game or
          draw is purchased, then the 24 Hours Period shall commence 24 hours
          prior to the beginning of such national holiday, bank holiday or any
          other day which is not a business day, and will also include the
          period of such national holiday, bank holiday or any other day which
          is not a business day. The Company is under no obligation to purchase
          any Ticket if the request to purchase such Ticket was made during the
          24 Hours Period. Without derogating from the above, the Company may
          purchase a Ticket even if the request to purchase it was made during
          the 24 Hours Period, but is under no obligation to do so. If a Ticket
          was not purchased due to the fact that the request to purchase it was
          made during the 24 Hours Period, the Company will purchase a similar
          (as far as possible) Ticket for the next lottery game or draw.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without derogating from any other provision of
          these Terms, where the Ticket was not purchased, the Company may, at
          its sole discretion, provide You with an alternative service aimed at
          securing Your enjoyment from the participation in the lottery draw;
          this will be performed by providing You with a similar product to the
          Ticket. For the avoidance of doubt, this service will be operated and
          implemented at the Company’s sole discretion in select instances. It
          is hereby clarified that the consideration to be paid for such service
          will be the same as the Consideration.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participation in the lottery draw (via
          purchasing a Ticket) is subject to, and in accordance with, the terms
          and conditions of these Terms and the laws, rules, terms and
          conditions under which the lottery draw is performed by the Operator (
          <strong>"Operator's Rules"</strong>).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your request to purchase any Ticket is subject
          to sufficient funds in Your Account to pay the Consideration or the
          provision of means of payment which allow the payment of the
          Consideration. If the funds in Your Account are insufficient for the
          payment of the Consideration or the means of payment provided by You
          do not allow the payment of the Consideration, either at the time of
          the request placed by You to purchase a Ticket or at the time in which
          the Company debits Your Account or the means of payment provided by
          You for any reason whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any
          limits placed by You, and any chargebacks or withdrawal of funds), or
          any time in between, the Company will not purchase the Ticket,
          regardless of whether Your request was registered with the Company or
          not; this will also be applied in case in which there is any change in
          the Consideration required by the Company for the purpose of
          purchasing the Ticket, even if that change occurred after You have
          requested the Company to purchase the Ticket or after Your request has
          been registered with the Company. The Company is under no obligation
          to notify You of any such occurrence, and it is Your sole
          responsibility to confirm that there are sufficient funds in Your
          Account to pay the Consideration or that the means of payment provided
          by You allow the payment of the Consideration. You hereby release,
          indemnify and hold Us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages,
          losses, costs and expenses arising from not purchasing the Tickets due
          to lack of funds, in whole or in part, in Your Account or the lack of
          possibility to debit the means of payment provided by You, in whole or
          in part. Without derogating from the above, You should verify that the
          Ticket was purchased by logging into Your Account and reviewing Your
          Tickets.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Account will only display Tickets
          purchased in the last 6 months as this ensures a fast and efficient
          browsing experience. Full Ticket history can be requested from our
          customer support at support@qiwilotto.com.{" "}

        <h1 className="item-title">8. PARTICIPATION WITH OTHER USERS</h1>
        <p>
          8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may offer, as a syndicate organizer
          and in respect of certain lotteries, the possibility to participate in
          the purchase of Tickets with other Users, in accordance with
          pre-determined programs provided by the Company (the{" "}
          <strong>"Programs"</strong>). The User participating in a Program will
          be contractually entitled to receive a portion of the Winnings
          attributed to the Tickets purchased in connection with that Program
          (subject to all other provisions of these Terms) in accordance with
          that User's share in that Program, and subject to the fee to be paid
          to the Company in connection with the setting up and management of the
          Program (the <strong>"Ratio"</strong>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If You choose to participate in a Program, You
          will be requested to inform the Company of the share of that Program
          You wish to purchase (subject to limitations provided in the Program).
          If not all of the shares of that Program are purchased, then the
          Company may, at its sole discretion, (i) purchase on its own behalf
          the remainder of the shares of that Program, or (ii) not purchase any
          Tickets in connection with that Program; the Company is under no
          obligation to provide You any notice to that effect, and it is Your
          sole responsibility to verify that the Tickets to be purchased in
          accordance with a Program were indeed purchased. The provisions of
          this section do not derogate from the provisions of sections 7.7 and
          7.8.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hereby clarified that the numbers to be
          used in connection with the Program could change at the Company's sole
          discretion. The numbers thus shown are solely for illustration
          purposes, and could be altered prior to the draw and between draws;
          You are not provided with any right to the numbers thus shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without derogating from other provisions of
          these Terms, it is hereby clarified that the Users participating in
          that Program are entitled to receive the Winnings according to their
          portion as calculated on the basis of the Ratio – all in accordance
          with these Terms.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Tickets participating in the Program
          are provided for free by the Company to the Users, then the Winnings
          attributed to any single Ticket will be distributed to the Users in
          accordance with the Ratio only where the total Winnings attributed to
          that Ticket are more than EUR 10,000 (ten thousand Euros); where the
          total Winnings attributed to any such single Ticket are EUR 10,000
          (ten thousand Euros) or less, then those Winnings will be transferred
          to the Company and the Company will be the sole owner of those
          Winnings.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="item-title">9. BONUS POLICY</h1>
        <p>
          9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All promotions, bonuses or special offers
          ("Bonus(es)") are subject to Bonus-specific terms and conditions and
          any Bonus must be used in adherence with such terms and conditions in
          order for the User to be eligible to receive the Bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Bonus received must be used in full within
          30 days from the date in which such Bonus is received; after such 30
          days period, if the Bonus is not used in full then the Company will
          withdraw such Bonus (including any Winnings generated from it) and You
          will not be entitled to such part of the Bonus (including any Winnings
          generated from it).
        </p>
        <p>
          9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Consideration for the purchase of Tickets is
          first deducted from the real money balance. When Your real money
          balance is nil, the purchase will be done from Your bonus balance. If
          the Consideration for the Tickets You wish to purchase is higher than
          Your real money balance, then the Consideration will be composed from
          Your real money balance and the remainder of the Consideration - from
          Your bonus balance. If, at a later stage, Your real money balance is
          higher than zero, any Consideration paid from that stage will once
          again be from Your real money balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonuses cannot be withdrawn under any
          circumstances.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reserves the right to prevent Users
          registered, logging in or depositing from certain jurisdictions from
          participating and being eligible for any or all Bonuses, at the
          Company’s sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this section 9 apply to all
          kind of Bonuses granted to You.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Company deems that a User
          has executed any act in bad faith in relation to any Bonus, tried to
          abuse any Bonus and/or or is likely to benefit through abuse or lack
          of good faith, then the Company may, at its sole discretion, deny,
          withhold or withdraw from such User any Bonus; this may be determined
          and the Bonus (and any Winnings gained from the Bonus) withheld or
          revoked, even after the award of the Bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The receiver of a Bonus shall be solely
          responsible for paying any relevant taxes levied in relation to the
          receipt of the Bonus.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company’s decision is final on all matters
          relating to a Bonus and shall not be subject to review or appeal by
          You or any third party

        <p>
          9.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reserves the right to alter,

        <p>
          10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the lottery draw, as published
          by the Operator, will be published on the Website after they are
          published by the Operator. For the avoidance of doubt, only the final
          results of the lottery draw as published by the Operator will
          determine the Winnings attributed to each Ticket, and in any case in
          which the results published on the Website differ from the results
          published by the Operator, the results published by the Operator will
          be the exclusive results that will determine the Winnings attributed
          to each Ticket. In any event in which the Operator revises, amends
          and/or corrects the results, such revised, amended and/or corrected
          results will determine the Winnings attributed to each Ticket.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the publication of the results of the
          lottery draw by the Operator, the Company will review whether any
          Tickets are entitled to receive any Winnings. Following such a review,
          the Company will notify the Users who are entitled to the Winnings in
          connection with that lottery draw; such notification will be done
          solely via the Your Account. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby
          acknowledged that the determination of entitlement to Winnings is
          determined solely by the Operator, and We will not be liable to You in
          connection with any error (including, but not limited, any error due
          to human and/or technical errors) in any notification (or lack of) of
          Winnings provided to You by the Company, including, but not limited
          to, errors in the determination of any entitlement to Winnings
          (whether You were wrongly or mistakenly notified You are entitled to
          Winnings, and/or whether You were wrongly or mistakenly not notified
          that You are not entitled to Winnings (including, but not limited to,
          where such error caused You to receive an amount smaller than the
          amount of Winnings You were entitled to absent such error, or no
          amount whatsoever)) and/or the amount of Winnings. It is hereby
          clarified that it is Your duty and obligation to review the official
          results published by the Operator, determine Your entitlement to any
          Winnings and notify the Company accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the determination of the Winnings or
          the notification to that effect by You to the Company, the Company
          will attempt to assist You with the collection of the Winnings from
          the Operator. For this purpose, You hereby provide the Company and
          anyone on its behalf with an irrevocable power of attorney for the
          collection of Winnings on Your behalf, to perform any action and
          execute any document and/or agreement for the purpose of collection of
          the Winnings. You also agree to perform any action and execute any
          document and/or agreement required for the purpose of implementing
          this power of attorney and collecting the Winnings. Without derogating
          from section 10.3, You hereby acknowledge that in some instances, the
          Operator may require You to collect the Winnings in person from the
          Operator at the Operator’s jurisdiction or any other place or require
          You to perform any other act in person; in which case You hereby
          absolve Us of any obligation and/or duty to collect the Winnings, and
          it is Your responsibility to collect such Winnings (including, but not
          limited to, bear all costs and/or expenses associated with such
          collection).
        </p>
        <p>
          10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that in any lottery
          draw in which it is possible to receive the Winnings in a lump sum or
          in installments, the Winnings will be collected and received in a lump
          sum, even if such choice carries with it diminution in the Winnings
          due to, without limitation, taxes, penalties, fees and/or the rules,
          terms and conditions of that lottery draw. You will have no claim

        </p>
        <p>
          18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Terms constitute the entire agreement

          18.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the Company at any time in

          18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed by and construed
          in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in United Kingdom. You

        <p>
          18.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of these Terms is found by a
          court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
          unenforceable in any respect, then such provision shall be excluded
          from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms shall be interpreted
          as if such provision was so excluded and shall be enforceable in
          accordance with their other provisions; provided, however, that in
          such event these Terms shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to
          the greatest extent consistent with and permitted by applicable law,
          to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined
          by such court of competent jurisdiction.

          against You.

          relationships or any other similar relationship between You and Us;
          (ii) create or confer any rights or benefits to any third party, or
